/**
 * <p>
 * The Transport interface defines how a Player can control the Playable items
 * it currently owns. This works much the way a remote control works for a DVD
 * player, offering user-initiated control (where supported) of playback and
 * transport controls.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because not all Players and Playables will support every method of transport,
 * control is generally expressed here as a Double that implies the rate of
 * playback. Special meaning is given to some values, but the interpretation of
 * a transport rate is otherwise left to the implementation classes.
